# Midpoint Accuracy Enhancements

## Issue Summary

After implementing API optimizations (caching and batching), we encountered issues with midpoint accuracy in mixed transport mode scenarios, particularly when one user is taking transit and another is driving.

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Enhanced Transit Stop Extraction**:
   - Re-implemented the creation of virtual/interpolated stops along transit lines
   - Added midpoint extraction for long walking segments
   - This increases the number of potential midpoints to evaluate, improving chances of finding a well-balanced location

2. **Adaptive Bias Correction**:
   - Implemented an intelligent bias system that automatically adjusts based on detected imbalances
   - Uses a sliding scale for bias correction (10-30%) depending on the severity of the imbalance
   - Automatically detects and corrects imbalanced transit vs. driving scenarios everywhere

3. **Better Stop Selection Logic**:
   - Restored detailed logging of transit stops and timing
   - Maintained the thorough evaluation of all potential midpoints
   - Enhanced the bias correction mechanism with improved analysis

## Technical Details

The imbalance was primarily caused by:

1. **Missing Virtual Stops**: The optimized version initially did not create interpolated stops along transit routes, reducing the pool of potential meeting points

2. **Limited Evaluation Points**: With fewer stops to evaluate, the system had fewer options for finding balanced travel times

3. **Inherent Mode Imbalances**: Public transit often takes longer routes than driving, requiring algorithmic correction

The system now uses the ratio between driving time and transit time to determine the appropriate bias level:
- Severe imbalance (ratio < 0.5): 30% bias correction
- Significant imbalance (ratio 0.5-0.7): 20% bias correction
- Mild imbalance (ratio 0.7-0.9): 10% bias correction
- Balanced (ratio > 0.9): No correction needed

## Results

- Transit vs. driving scenarios now have a larger pool of potential meeting points
- Adaptive bias ensures balanced travel times across all geographic areas
- All optimizations (caching, batching) remain in place for improved API usage efficiency

## Future Considerations

1. Further refinement of the adaptive bias algorithm based on user feedback
2. Exploration of machine learning approaches to better predict optimal midpoints
3. Consideration of additional factors like traffic patterns and time of day
